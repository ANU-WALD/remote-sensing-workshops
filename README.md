# remote-sensing-workshops

2017 workshop activities for [ENVS3109](http://programsandcourses.anu.edu.au/course/ENVS3019)
(other content online [here](http://wenfo.org/wald/advanced-remote-sensing))


## How this works

In each workshop, you work through that week's exploratory analysis
using Python in an interactive [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/).
This should take about two hours, leaving one hour for you to experiment
with other data or help out if someone is stuck.

Alternatively, you can do the analysis excercises on your own time
earlier in the week, and do a more advanced workshop.
Each advanced session will focus on teaching you how to use a single key
tool for scientific computing or software development.
These optional sessions complement rather than replace the core
workshops, and do not contribute to your assessment for the course
(ie. you'd better do the other work too).


## Core workshops

1. Introduction to Python
2. Basic image analysis
3. Vegetation over time
4. Water Observations from Space
5. *TODO: something about Himawari?  Or student choice from NCI workshops*


## Extension workshops

- Testing your code
- Track and share your code with Git
- Pandas, for fluent data analysis
