    "**A brief digression on digital number formats**\n",
    "\n",
    "What you need to know: *use integer types for integer data, floats for fractional data or if you have missing values.  Use dtypes with plenty of bits to avoid errors or imprecise calculations.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the data type matter - aren't all numbers basically the same?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's true in maths class, where you probably learned about integers (whole numbers), rationals (fractions), and stranger things like irrational or complex numbers (which aren't relevant today).  These have lovely properties like \"can have any number of digits\" and \"adding, multiplying, or dividing any two fractions results in a fraction\".  Here's where it gets tricky:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Computers represent everything as bits, meaning that all integers must be represented in binary (aka base-2).  In binary you count `0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, ...` instead of `0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...`.\n",
    "- Computers represent *everything* as bits.  This has to include the sign (positive or negative?), and where one number starts and ends.\n",
    "- The most efficient way to do this is to have an array of numbers, all of which take a fixed number of bytes (a group of eight bits).  The *array* is then labelled as either unsigned (positive-only) or signed (first bit is one == negative).  *This is a good time to ask any questions.*\n",
    "- Choosing your data type is therefore very important - are negative values possible?  Will your maximum value ever be above `2**8=256`?  If so, you need more than one byte!  If you do a calculation with an unrepresentable output, results may vary: \"undefined\" for unsigned ints (ie you get an error, or maybe Bad Things happen), while signed ints will \"wrap around\" to the other end of the range (breaking relationships like `n + 1 > n`!).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `before` array isn't integers though - it's a floating point number (to be exact: little-endian four-byte float, often called 'single-precision', google terms or ask me for details you don't need).  [Floating-point numbers are complicated (wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Floating-point_arithmetic), but the gist is that they use scientific notation in binary, with some special cases for infinity and 'not a number' (eg `1/0 -> nan`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider representing numbers in base-10 scientific notation, with at most three characters: one each for the sign, significand, and exponent.  So zero is `0.0 * 10^0`, or `+00`.  Three is `+30` (`3 * 10^0`), and negative three hundred is `-32`... but so is negative three-hundred-and-four!\n",
    "\n",
    "This loss of precision in cumulative over your calculations, but luckily the standard sizes of 32 and 64 bit floats are pretty good - with 32 bits you can measure the distance from Canberra to the equator with a precision of a meter or so, and with 64 bits you can measure from the Sun to Pluto... in *micrometers*.  The usual approach is to store data in 32bit (`f4`), and calculate in `f4` unless you're doing very many or very sensitive calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For NDVI, which is mostly between zero and one (and occasionally -4 .. +8), `f4` is verging on overkill.  (We use it anyway because it's standard, and handles missing data natively)\n",
