    "# Image Analysis with Python\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we're going to do some simple analyses of a Landsat image.  By the end, you will have learned a bit about file formats for images, how to load and visualise gridded data, combined bands, and calculated some indices such as NDVI.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below, I've written some demonstration code to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. load an aerial image of the ANU campus\n",
    "2. slice the array (eg monochrome images, mean colour)\n",
    "3. view the image\n",
    "4. calculate and view NDVI\n",
    "\n",
    "And after you run this, the second half of the workshop is to write your own analysis of a MODIS image!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let's import the libraries (packages of code) that we want to use for this task.  `numpy` is the foundation of scientific Python, by supporting very fast numerical operations on arrays.  `matplotlib`, well, is a matlab-style plotting library; we're importing `seaborn` because it makes the default styles much nicer (and has nice statistical graphs, but that's a topic for an optional session later).  `xarray` [(docs)](http://xarray.pydata.org) is the nicest way to work with labelled multidimensional data - specialised, but indispensible for us."

    "*Note that `xarray`, our 'library' for working with gridded data in NetCDF files, is perfectly happy with a URL instead of a filename.\n",
    "Because this data is provided via OpenDAP (**D**ata **A**ccess **P**rotocol), `xarray` will automatically avoid downloading data until you need it - so opening very large collections of files only transfers a little metadata, and taking subsets is usually quite efficient.*"
